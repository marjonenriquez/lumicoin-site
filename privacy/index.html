        <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our practices regarding your information and how we will treat it.</p>

          <li>Communicate with you, such as to send you updates, security alerts, and support messages.</li>
          <li>Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with our Service.</li>

        <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
        <p>We may share your information in the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We may share your information with third-party vendors, consultants, and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf (e.g., cloud hosting, analytics, customer support). These providers are contractually obligated to protect your information.</li>
            <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose your information if we believe that disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request.</li>
            <li><strong>To Protect Rights and Property:</strong> We may disclose your information if we believe it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of LümiCoin, our users, or the public.</li>
            <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may share your information for other purposes with your consent or at your direction.</li>
            <li><strong>Aggregated or De-identified Data:</strong> We may share aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you. For example, we may share aggregated usage statistics with partners or for research purposes.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable measures, including administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, to protect your information from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error-free, so you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Service is not intended for individuals under the age of 13 (or a higher age threshold where applicable under local law). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you by revising the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about our information practices.</p>
