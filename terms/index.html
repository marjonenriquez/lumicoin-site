        <p class="effective-date"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> June 4, 2025</p>

        <p>Welcome to LümiCoin! These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the LümiCoin mobile application (the “App”), website (lumicoin.app), and any related services (collectively, the “Service”) provided by LümiCoin Inc. (“we,” “us,” or “our”). Please read these Terms carefully.</p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By creating an account, downloading the App, accessing our website, or using any part of the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy (available at <a href="privacy.html">lumicoin.app/privacy</a>), which is incorporated herein by reference. If you do not agree to all of these Terms, do not use the Service.</p>

        <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>You must be at least 18 years old, or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction, to create an account and use the Service. If you are under the age of 18, you may use the Service only with the involvement and consent of a parent or legal guardian. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you meet these eligibility requirements.</p>

        <h2>3. Account Registration and Security</h2>
        <p>To use most features of the Service, you must register for an account. You agree to: (a) provide accurate, current, and complete information as prompted by any registration forms on the Service; (b) maintain and promptly update such information to keep it accurate, current, and complete; (c) maintain the security of your password and accept all risks of unauthorized access to your account and the information you provide to us; and (d) promptly notify us if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to the Service or your account.</p>

        <h2>4. The LümiCoin Service</h2>
        <p>LümiCoin is a behavioral health platform that aims to quantify and reward your self-care efforts. The Service allows you to connect your Apple HealthKit data (with your explicit permission) or other compatible health data sources to track activities like steps, sleep, hydration, and mindful minutes. Based on this data and our proprietary algorithms, you may earn “LümiCoins” or other forms of virtual rewards within the App.</p>
        <p><strong>Important Disclaimer:</strong> LümiCoin is not a medical device or service. The information, insights, and rewards provided through the Service are for informational, motivational, and general wellness purposes only. They should not be considered medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health, diet, or treatment. Do not disregard, avoid, or delay obtaining medical advice from a healthcare professional because of something you have read or seen on the Service. Reliance on any information provided by LümiCoin is solely at your own risk.</p>

        <h2>5. User Conduct</h2>
        <p>You agree not to misuse the Service or help anyone else to do so. You agree that you will not, directly or indirectly:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Attempt to manipulate data, earn rewards fraudulently, or otherwise game the system.</li>
            <li>Interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Service or the data contained therein.</li>
            <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service or its related systems or networks.</li>

            <li>Transmit any worms, viruses, or any code of a destructive nature.</li>
        </ul>

We may, in our sole discretion, offer opportunities to use LümiCoins for certain in-app features, benefits, or to facilitate contributions to third-party charitable organizations. The availability, exchange rates, and conditions for using LümiCoins are subject to change at our sole discretion without notice. We reserve the right to manage, regulate, control, modify, or eliminate LümiCoins as we see fit, and we shall have no liability to you or any third party for the exercise of such rights.</p>

        <h2>9. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

        <h2>10. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. If we make changes that we believe are material, we will provide you with notice, such as by updating the “Last Updated” date at the top of these Terms, sending an email, or providing a notice through the Service. Your continued use of the Service after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms. If you do not agree to any changes, you must stop using the Service.</p>

        <h2>11. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled by arbitration in New York County, New York, in English, in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. ("JAMS") then in effect.</p>
